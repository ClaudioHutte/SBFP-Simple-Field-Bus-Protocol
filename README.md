# SBFP-Simple-Field-Bus-Protocol
The Simple Field Bus Protocol (SFBP) is a protocol developed to support peer-to-peer (multi-master) communication across RS-485 or radio networks. Conceived to be lightweight it best fits microcontrollers like the AVR series and it is especially suited for even-driven execution.
